        <p>
            I'm a self-taught Java Developer who has been on this journey since the very start of 2019! Here I am now, ready to share my story, thoughts, and projects to anyone here.
        </p>

            This is a blog where I share my journey learning how to code with technologies I'm currently studying, considering on learning, or just finding anything interesting!
            
            A few things about myself, I'm a huge nerd when it comes to tech in general. Reaching from coding (obviously), PC building, devices, and much more.
            I'm also very fond of music of pretty much any genre. I welcome any song recommended to me my way.
            I really like gaming and I very much enjoy cooking. Unfortunately, I don't know how to bake, but that's another thing I would love to learn as well!
